Duplicate the 'en' folder and name it with the new language 2 letter language code.

There should be 2 files in the folder:

"messages.json"     - This contains locales for the addon store page.

"translations.json" - This is the main locales file.
                    - Delete the first line "cobalt_version". (It will default back to the 'en' locale).
                    - Copying chunks of this json file into chatGPT is a quick way to translate in one go, but please double check to make sure it translated correctly, and that it kept the locale IDs intact.


Thank you for helping! :)
